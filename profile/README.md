Hi, and welcome! This GitHub organization hosts code for two entities (between which there is lots of crossover).

The first entity is [Cephalon Intelligence](https://www.cephalon.io) - a (soon to be) private company providing alternative data services.

The second entity is [The CIO (Cephalon Intelligence Organization)](https://www.thecio.wiki) - a (partially) open source intelligence organization that aims to conduct benevolent social engineering operations.
